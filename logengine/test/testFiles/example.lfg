# The maximum size of log file in kilobytes.
# LogEngine will not create log files with size more than the specified.
# When log file reaches MaxLogSize a backup file will be created. 
# The names and number of backup files depends on BackupType parameter.
# By default MaxLogSize = 100 (100 kilobytes).
# MaxLogSize = 0 means no limit on log file size.
MaxLogSize = 100

# The BackupType parameter controls the creation of backup files.
# Possible values : None, Single, Timestamp.
# None      - when log file reaches MaxLogFile size no new file is created and 
#             current file is rewritten from the beginning.
# Single    - when log file reaches MaxLogFile size it is renamed to the .bak 
#             file. If file with .bak extention is already exists it will be 
#             rewritten.
# TimeStamp - when log file reaches MaxLogFile size it is renamed using the 
#             following template: logfilename(yyyy-mm-dd hh.mm.ss).log

# Log Templates. 
# Each template allows to set the format in which log information will be saved to 
# the log file. 
# Format macros are as follows:
#  %APPNAME% - the name of application
#  %APPVERSION% - the version of application. Can have x.x.x.x format or other.
#  %TIME% - current time
#  %DATE% - current date
#  %DATETIME% - the current date and time in 
#  %THREAD% - current thread ID
#  %MSG% - log message
#  %OS% - OS name (for example Microsoft Windows 98)
#  %OSVERSION% - OS version number (for example "5.1.0.2666")
#  %DETAILLEVEL% - Detail level for log messages.
#
# Log line can be any combination of format macros and letters. 
# Letters that is not macros will be copied to the output stream without changing.
# The example of template line : '%TIME% #%THREAD% : %MSG%'
# NOTE! MACROS ARE CASE SENSITIVE AND MUST BE IN UPEER CASE.
