TODO
----
This file contains an imcomplete list of things to be done, not necessarily
ordered by importance or urgence.


* Add possibility to write logs into multiple files (multiple LogFileName 
  directives in .lfg file)

* Get the version number from current module (for Windows only)

* Find out why automake-1.7 is required in make, it's dumb and silly

* Add a set of help functions FormatError, FormatInfo which returns formatted 
  string for InternalWrite. They helps us to write tests more comfortable. - DONE

* Add separator line

* Add support to different log destinations: file, OutputDebugString, probably pipes.

* Synchronization logs in separate thread. - DONE

* Add log file rotation. 1->2, 2->3 ....

* DateTimeMacro works wrong (as TimeMacro) - DONE
